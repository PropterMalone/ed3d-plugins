# Changelog

## ed3d-plan-and-execute 1.1.0

Corrects design plan level of detail. These changes were a missed port from the internal plugin marketplace and were intended for 1.0.0. This release represents the plugin "as intended."

**Changed:**
- **writing-design-plans**: Design plans now stay at component/module level, not task level. Contracts/interfaces can be fully specified; implementation code cannot.
- **brainstorming**: Added guidance on level of detail in Phase 3. Validates boundaries, not behavior.
- **writing-implementation-plans**: Strengthened codebase verification as source of truth. Implementation plans generate code fresh from investigation, never copy from design.
- **README**: Added "Philosophy: What Each Phase Produces" section explaining archival vs just-in-time distinction.

## ed3d-research-agents 1.1.0

Added `remote-code-researcher` agent for investigating external codebases by cloning and analyzing their source code.

**New agent:**
- `remote-code-researcher` - Answers questions about external libraries/frameworks by cloning repos to temp directories and investigating the actual source code. Combines web search (to find repos) with codebase investigation (to analyze cloned code).

## All plugins 1.0.0

Initial release of ed3d-plugins collection.
